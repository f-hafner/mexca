Welcome to mexca's Documentation!
=================================

**Mexca** is an open-source Python package which aims to capture human emotion expressions from videos in a single pipeline.

Check out our `features <https://mexca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html>`_ page to get information on how **mexca** extracts emotion expressions and our `output <https://mexca.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html>`_ page on which features are captured.

If you would like to learn how to use **mexca**, we recommend starting with one of our `examples <https://github.com/mexca/mexca/tree/main/examples>`_.
Note that the demo runs in a [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter lets users easily combine markdown text with executable Python code on a canvas called 'notebook'. For installing jupyter, and using the notebook please refer to the [official installation guide](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install/notebook-classic.html).
