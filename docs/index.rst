mexca is an open-source Python package which aims to capture human emotion expressions from videos in a single pipeline.

Check out our :ref:`Components` page to get information on how mexca extracts emotion expressions and our :ref:`Output` page on which features are captured.

Get started right away with a short example shown in the :ref:`Getting Started` section or our `demo <https://github.com/mexca/mexca/tree/main/examples/demo.ipynb>`_ notebook.

If you would like to learn how to use mexca, we recommend starting with one of our `examples <https://github.com/mexca/mexca/tree/main/examples>`_. Note that the examples are written as `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks.
See the :ref:`Installation Details` on how to install and start Jupyter.
